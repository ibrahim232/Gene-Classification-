# Machine Learning for Cancer Prediction Using RNA-seq Data

## Project Overview

In this project, we delve into the domain of bioinformatics with the goal of predicting cancer types using machine learning techniques. The core of our analysis is an RNA-seq Gene Expression dataset, which plays a pivotal role in our predictive modeling.

### Dataset Description

The dataset underpinning our project consists of RNA-seq Gene Expression data across various cancer types. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) provides us with a comprehensive view of the transcriptome, offering insights into the quantity and sequences of RNA in a sample. In the context of cancer research, analyzing these expression profiles can reveal patterns that distinguish between different types of cancers, thus aiding in their identification and characterization.

**Structure**: The dataset is structured with samples as rows and gene count values as columns. Each row represents a cancer sample, encapsulating the expression levels of thousands of genes. The columns, apart from the last one, correspond to these genes and their respective count values within each sample.
  
**Target Variable**: The last column in our dataset is of particular interest as it contains the labels for our predictive model ‚Äì the cancer categories. This categorical variable will serve as the target for our machine learning algorithms, guiding them in learning the complex relationships between gene expressions and cancer types.

- **KIRC**: Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma. This is a type of kidney cancer that originates in the lining of the proximal convoluted tubule, a part of the very small tubes in the kidney that transport primary urine.

- **BRCA**: Breast Invasive Carcinoma. This type represents cancers that have spread from the original site in the breast to surrounding tissues. It's the most common type of breast cancer.

- **COAD**: Colon Adenocarcinoma. A cancer of the colon which is characterized by a malignant growth formed from the glandular structures in the epithelial tissue.

- **LUAD**: Lung Adenocarcinoma. This type is a form of non-small cell lung cancer, which tends to grow slower than other lung cancers. It is found in the outer parts of the lung and is the most common type of lung cancer among non-smokers.

- **PRAD**: Prostate Adenocarcinoma. This cancer develops in the prostate gland and is the most common form of prostate cancer. It begins in the gland cells of the prostate.

### Objective

Our primary objective is to build and evaluate machine learning models that can accurately predict the type of cancer based on the gene expression profiles provided in the dataset. By achieving this, we aim to contribute to the broader efforts in cancer diagnosis and treatment, potentially offering insights that could guide personalized medicine approaches.

### Approach 

To accomplish our goal, we will:
- Perform an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of variables, the structure of our dataset, and any patterns or anomalies present.
- Preprocess the data to make it suitable for machine learning models, including normalization, handling missing values, and feature selection.
- Train various machine learning models, comparing their performance to identify the most effective approach for cancer type prediction.
- Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy and robustness.

By the end of this project, we hope to have a robust predictive model that showcases the power of machine learning in the field of bioinformatics, specifically for cancer type prediction through RNA-seq gene expression data analysis.
